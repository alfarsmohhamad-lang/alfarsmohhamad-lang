## 📌 About Me  
Hi, I'm Abdelghani Mohamed Abdelghani, a 21-year-old Data Analyst and final-year commerce student at Al-Azhar University. I have a strong academic foundation in accounting, finance, and management, complemented by practical training in computer applications and Microsoft Office.  

I am deeply passionate about data analysis and extracting meaningful insights. I collect data from multiple sources, organize it systematically, and ensure its accuracy through careful cleaning and validation. I then analyze it to identify key patterns and trends, and design interactive reports and dashboards that support informed decision-making.  

I am proficient in Excel, SQL, Power BI, Tableau, and Python, with strong analytical and communication skills that enable me to bridge technical insights with real business needs.  

I help startups and entrepreneurs leverage data through interactive dashboards and precise analytics, empowering them to uncover opportunities, overcome challenges, and gain a competitive advantage from the outset.
